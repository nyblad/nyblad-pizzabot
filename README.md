# Project 4 - Pizzabot
Project week 4 @ Technigo Bootcamp 2019 was to create a pizzabot (pair-programming). <br>
The pizzabot has a menu of three pizzas and you can order one sort and also type in how many. The bot response with how much it will cost and how long time it will take to cook them.

This was a pair-programming project so afterwards I have made my own pizzabot with my own twist to try out some more functions.<br><br>
